1. Encapsulation: 
    idea of binding data and methods that work on that data on that unit
    like a class and it can be used to hide the internal representation
    instance is the state of the class.
    
    we can have 
    a.  Weak Encapsulation
        i. Public data and methods
        ii. can be accessed both outside and inside of a class 
    b. Moderate Encapsulation
        i. Protected data and methods
        ii. Can be accessed by the class or its subclass
    c. Complete Encapsulation
        i. Private data and methods
        ii. Can only be accessed inside its own class
