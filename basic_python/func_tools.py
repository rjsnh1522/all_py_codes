from functools import wraps

# Preserves the metadata (e.g., __name__, __doc__) of the original function when creating decorators.

# functools.partial
# Fixes some arguments of a function, creating a new function with fewer arguments.


# functools.partialmethod
# Similar to partial, but designed for methods in classes.

# functools.lru_cache
# Memoizes a function, caching its results to avoid redundant computations.


# functools.reduce
# reduce iterable to single value
